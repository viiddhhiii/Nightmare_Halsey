            <p>
                Now I lay me down to sleep <br>
                I pray the Lord my soul to keep<br>
                If I shall die before I 'wake<br>
                I pray the Lord my soul to take<br>
                I, I keep a record of the wreckage of my life<br>
                I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind<br>
                They talk shit, but I love it every time<br>
                And I realize<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                I've tasted blood and it is sweet<br>
                I've had the rug pulled beneath my feet<br>
                I've trusted lies and trusted men<br>
                Broke down and put myself back together again<br>
                Stared in the mirror and punched it to shatters<br>
                Collected the pieces and picked out a dagger<br>
                I've pinched my skin in between my two fingers<br>
                And wished I could cut some parts off with some scissors<br>
                <br><br>
                "Come on, little lady, give us a smile"<br>
                No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about<br>
                I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for<br>
                A moment to say I don't owe you a goddamn thing<br>
                I, I keep a record of the wreckage of my life<br>
                I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind<br>
                They talk shit, but I love it every time<br>
                And I realize<br>
                <br><br>
                I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night<br>
                That I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night<br>
                No, I won't smile, but I'll show you my teeth<br>
                And I'ma let you speak if you just let me breathe<br>
                I've been polite, but won't be caught dead<br>
                Lettin' a man tell me what I should do in my bed<br>
                Keep my exes in check in my basement<br>
                'Cause kindness is weakness, or worse, you're complacent<br>
                <br><br>
                I could play nice or I could be a bully<br>
                I'm tired and angry, but somebody should be<br>
                "Come on, little lady, give us a smile"<br>
                No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about<br>
                I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for<br>
                A moment to say I don't owe you a goddamn thing<br>
                I, I keep a record of the wreckage of my life<br>
                I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind<br>
                They talk shit, but I love it every time<br>
                And I realize<br>
                <br><br>
                I, I keep a record of the wreckage of my life<br>
                I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind<br>
                They talk shit, but I love it every time<br>
                And I realize<br>
                <br><br>
                Someone like me can be a real nightmare, completely aware<br>
                But I'd rather be a real nightmare than die unaware, yeah<br>
                Someone like me can be a real nightmare, completely aware<br>
                But I'm glad to be a real nightmare, so save me your prayers<br>
                I, I keep a record of the wreckage of my life<br>
                I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind<br>
                They talk shit, but I love it every time<br>
                And I realize<br>
                <br><br>
                I, I keep a record of the wreckage of my life<br>
                I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind<br>
                They talk shit, but I love it every time<br>
                And I realize<br>
                I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night<br>
                That I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night<br>
